## True Interprocess Shared Memory (Proof of Concepte Stage)

Share your data between your Python processes (2 processes currently) and work with them as usual. Work across different processes is made turn by turn (fast operation: using full memory barrier instead of system calls)

Supported types (currently):

* `list` - Unlike `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList`: **mutable** and **resizable** between different processes, supports other containers (lists, tuples, dicts) as an items and implements all `list` methods. Faster than `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList`.
* `dict` - *currently immutable*
* `tuple`
* `str`
* `bytes`
* `bytearray`
* `bool`
* `float` - Unlike values in `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList`, supports Addition Assignment (`shared_list[20] += 999.3`) and all other native methods and operators
* `int` - int64, currently. Unlike values in `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList`, supports Addition Assignment (`shared_list[15] += 999`) and all other native methods and operators
* `None`

### Examples

[shared_memory_example.py](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal/blob/master/cengal/hardware/memory/shared_memory/versions/v_0/development/shared_memory_example.py)

and smaller:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
from cengal.hardware.memory.shared_memory import *


shared_memory_name = 'test_shared_mem'
shared_memory_size = 200 * 1024 * 1024
switches = 1000
changes_per_switch = 2000


def work(manager, shared_data)
    index = 0
    while index < switches:
        with wait_my_turn(manager):
            # emulatin our working process
            for i in range(changes_per_switch):
                shared_data[1] += 1

def second_process():
    consumer: SharedMemory = SharedMemory('test_shmem', False)
    consumer.wait_for_messages()
    with wait_my_turn(consumer):
        shared_data = consumer.take_message()
    
    work(consumer, shared_data)


creator: SharedMemory = SharedMemory(shared_memory_name, True, shared_memory_size)
p = Process(target=second_process)
p.start()
creator.wait_consumer_ready()
with wait_my_turn(creator):
    data = [
        'hello',
        0,
        (8, 2.0, False),
        {
            b'world': -6,
            5: 4
        }
    ]
    shared_data = creator.put_message(data)

work(creator, shared_data)
p.join()
```

### Performance Benchmark results

Shared `list` container (which is not yet fully optimizes currently) is already faster than `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList`.
And unlike `multiprocessing.shared_memory.ShareableList` supports Addition Assignment (`shared_list[15] += 999`) and all other native methods and operators of items.
It provides an ability to make more than 30000000 reads/writes per second of an int64 value (`shared_list[2] = 1234` / `val = shared_list[7]`) or more than 1450000 addition assignments per second (`shared_list[15] += 999`).

[Benchmark Results](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal/blob/master/cengal/hardware/memory/shared_memory/versions/v_0/development/benchmark_results.md)


### Roadmap

* Continuosly moving more logic to Cython
* Implement mutable `dict` and `set` using an appropricate C hashmap library or C++ code (depending what will be faster in our case)
* Increase number of interacting processes from 2 to variable value
* Implement garbage collector for shared data in addition to manual `free()` call
* Implement an appropriate Service for `cengal.parallel_execution.coroutines` - for comfortable shared memory usage inside an async code (including `asyncio`) 
* Improve memory allocation algorithm in an attempt of making it faster

# Modules with unique functionality

* **"parallel_execution"**
    * **"coroutines"** - asynchronous loop with almost preemptive multitasking within the single thread. Brings an async approach to an unmodified Tkinter, Qt, Kivy, etc. Unlike asyncio/trio/curio, it uses microkernel (services-based) approach which makes it highly- and easily-expandable. Can be executed both independently (asyncio/uvloop loop will be injected within the Cengal-coroutine when needed) and within already executed asyncio/uvloop loop. Can be used from the PyScript for the Web app creation.
        * **"coro_standard_services"** - set of standard services. You can replace standard service by yours for your app or for third-party module without code changes: by registering your own alias.
            * **"loop_yield"** - automatically kinda yield from your loops from time to time (priority based). Can be used to make a proper coroutine (which will not hangs on its endless loops) even from the long-running CPU-hungry third-party function (by function's bytecode modification made in runtime).
            * **"tkinter"** - make your Tkninter app async easily. Run any number of asynchronous Tkinter apps in single thread.
            * **"db"** - async wrapper around LMDB which provides an appropriate async API
            * **"asyncio_loop"** - use asyncio-based code directly from your async Cengal-coroutine neither [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) nor [Curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio) able to to do this
            * **"wait_coro"** - 'put_atomic' request is an analogue of [Trio's Nurseries](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) for list of one or more coroutines; 'put_fastest' - returns when at least N of coroutines from the list were done successfully; etc.
            * **"read_write_locker"** - sync primitive usefull for DB creation (was made for a TagDB)
            * **"remote_nodes"** - in progress - connect to any opened listener/port of the node (TCP/UDP/Unix_Socket - doesn't matter), and identify your receiver by name (defined once - during the connection creation process). Uses improved version of the asyncio.streams as a backend in order to have a back pressure and an improved performance (see "efficient_streams" module description below).
        * **"coro_tools"** - tools
            * **"await_coro"** - await Cengal-coroutine or await for a call to the Cengal-service from your asyncio code
            * **"low_latency"** - use standard json module from your coroutines without hangs on huge Json-data (which usually hung even fast json implementation like orjson)
        * **"integrations"** - 
            * **"Qt"** - wrapper around an unmodified Qt (supports: PySide, PySide2, PySide6, PyQt4, PyQt5, PyQt6). Adds asynchronous behavior to Slots. Doesn't require total reimplementation of your Qt app unlike other suggestions and competitors.
            * **"customtkinter"** - wrapper around an unmodified [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). Implements an additional call, Customtkinter async apps needs to be executed for a proper work
            * **"nicegui"** - wrapper around an unmodified [NiceGUI](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui). Execute nicegui instance from within your code (administrative page for example). Build your pages in an asynchronous way in order to improve your server latency (NiceGUI makes it in a sync way).
            * **"uvicorn"** - wrapper around an unmodified [uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn). Run uvicorn as a usual asyncio coroutine.
            * **"uvloop"** - an easy-install for a [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) (if awailable).
            * **"PyTermGUI"** - wrapper around an unmodified PyTermGUI. Adds asynchronous behavior. No competitors currently.
    * **"asyncio"** - tools for an asyncio
        * **"efficient_streams"** - more efficient remake of an [asyncion.streams](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html). Better awailable traffic limits utilisation. Less kerner-calls number. Back pressure. Unlike asyncio, UDP version is planned but is not ready yet.
* **"code_flow_control"** - 
    * **"python_bytecode_manipulator"** - modify your or third-party Python function's code in runtime easily
    * **"chained_flow"** - easy to use monad. Execute your your code if all/none/some of steps were completed withot an exceptions. Use all/none/some resutls of your steps at the final part of monad execution.
    * **"multiinterface_essence"** - Make your model and add different interfaces to it easily. Can be used for example in games: create "chair", "ball", "person" models and add to them your library of general interfaces like "touch", "push", "sit", "shot", "burn", "wet", etc.
* **"hardware"** - hardware related
    * **"memory"** - RAM related
        * **"barriers"** - fast full memory barriers for both x86/x64 and ARM (Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS, Android).
* **"time_management"** - 
    * **"high_precision_sync_sleep"** - provides an ability to put your thread into legetimate sleep for at least 10x smaller time period than `time.sleep()` from the Python's Standard Library able to do on same Operating System: uses `nanosleep()` on Linux and periodic `SwitchToThread()` on Windows.
    * **"cpu_clock_cycles"** - Returnes value of `RDTSCP` on x86/x86_64 or `CNTVCT_EL0` on ARM. Fast implementation: 6-12 times faster than all other competitors on Github. Note: CPU Time Stamp Counter (TSC) is not depends on actual current CPU frequency in modern CPUs (starting from around year 2007) so can be safely used as a high precision clock (see `time_management.cpu_clock` module). Windows, Linux and other Operating Systems are using it internaly.
    * **"cpu_clock"** - like `perf_counter()` but 25% faster. Supports both x86/x86_64 and ARM. `cpu_clock` is slightly faster than `cpu_clock_cycles` because `double` (`float` in Python terms) transfered from C-code to Python code more efficiently than `64-bit int` (which needs an addition internal logic inside the Python itself for conversion). Highest-precision possible since it is CPU Time Stamp Counter based which is not depends on actual current CPU frequency in modern CPUs (starting from around year 2007) so can be safely used as a high precision clock (and Windows, Linux and other Operating Systems are using it internaly in this way). **Benchmark**: [cpu_clock_test.py](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal/blob/master/cengal/time_management/cpu_clock/versions/v_0/development/cpu_clock_test.py)
