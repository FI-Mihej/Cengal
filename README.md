# Cengal

Cengal is a versatile Python library designed for a wide range of applications. To enhance performance, certain modules within Cengal have been implemented using Cython, C/C++, Nim or Go.

## Architecture & API Design Rationale

<details>
<summary title="Rationale"><kbd> Rationale </kbd></summary>

The Cengal library adheres to an API design approach used in frameworks such as Qt. For those familiar with the C++ language, I will draw comparisons between the approaches of Qt and the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The API provided by the STL was designed to significantly reduce the burden on programmers who develop the STL. This decision was logical from the standpoint of marketing the STL among compiler creators. However, this led to the usability of the STL for the user not being great. This is evident in the fact that the STL provides the most minimal possible API, and any conveniences must be programmed anew by each programmer every time - constantly reinventing the wheel. In contrast, Qt uses the opposite approach to API construction: classes have many methods whose purposes are similar, but are aimed at different usage models. This simplifies the use of Qt for users, speeds up the writing of the final code, and avoids many errors that we usually make when we write our own 'bicycles' for the same actions each time (not because the we are not smart, but because we are humans and therefore prone to make mistakes from time to time).

# Stand-Alone Packages for Specific Cengal Modules

<details>
<summary title="Rationale"><kbd> Rationale </kbd></summary>

To cater to varying needs and streamline the installation process, I've introduced stand-alone packages for select Cengal modules. These packages are designed to offer users the ability to install specific Cengal functionality without the burden of the library's full set of dependencies.

The core of this approach lies in our 'cengal-light' package, which houses both Python and compiled Cengal modules. The 'cengal' package itself serves as a lightweight shell, devoid of its own modules, but dependent on 'cengal-light[full]' for a complete Cengal library installation with all required dependencies.

For users seeking individual Cengal features or looking to minimize dependencies, our stand-alone packages provide a convenient solution. Each stand-alone package is dedicated to a specific Cengal module and relies on 'cengal-light' as its sole dependency.

</details>

Below, you'll find a list of these stand-alone packages, each corresponding to a distinct Cengal module:

* [CengalPolyBuild](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/CengalPolyBuild): A Comprehensive and Hackable Build System for Multilingual Python Packages: Cython (including automatic conversion from Python to Cython), C/C++, Objective-C, Go, and Nim, with ongoing expansions to include additional languages. (Planned to be released soon) 
* [InterProcessPyObjects](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/InterProcessPyObjects) (package for `cengal.parallel_execution.asyncio.ashared_memory_manager` module): High-performance package delivers blazing-fast inter-process communication through shared memory, enabling Python objects to be shared across processes with exceptional efficiency. 
* [cengal_memory_barriers](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/cengal_memory_barriers) (package for `cengal.hardware.memory.barriers` module): Fast crossplatform memory barriers for Python.
* [cengal_cpu_info](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/cengal_cpu_info) (package for `cengal.hardware.info.cpu` module): Extended, cached CPU info with consistent output format.
* [cengal_app_dir_path_finder](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/cengal_app_dir_path_finder) (package for `cengal.file_system.app_fs_structure.app_dir_path` module): Offering a unified API for easy retrieval of OS-specific application directories, enhancing data management across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Stay tuned for future additions to our collection of stand-alone packages!

## Concurrent Execution of blocking CPU-Bound and GUI Tasks on a Single Thread

Cengal offers a unique and powerful feature that allows you to execute a diverse set of tasks concurrently on a single thread, effectively managing CPU-bound and GUI-related operations without introducing the complexity of multithreading or multiprocessing. Notably, Cengal can convert `blocking CPU-bound` functions into proper asynchronous coroutines, preventing them from blocking the thread for extended periods.

### Examples

In this example, an application concurrently (at the same time) executes all of the following components within a single thread:
* own **blocking** CPU-bound function
* third-party **blocking** CPU-bound function
* Tkinter application
* CustomTkinter application
* asyncio-based file reading task.

# Modules with unique functionality

<details>
<summary title="Unique modules List (was not updated for some time)"><kbd> Unique modules List (was not updated for some time) </kbd></summary>

* **"parallel_execution"**
    * **"coroutines"** - asynchronous loop with almost preemptive multitasking within the single thread. Brings an async approach to an unmodified Tkinter, Qt, Kivy, etc. Unlike asyncio/trio/curio, it uses microkernel (services-based) approach which makes it highly- and easily-expandable. Can be executed both independently (asyncio/uvloop loop will be injected within the Cengal-coroutine when needed) and within already executed asyncio/uvloop loop. Can be used from the PyScript for the Web app creation.
        * **"coro_standard_services"** - set of standard services. You can replace standard service by yours for your app or for third-party module without code changes: by registering your own alias.
            * **"loop_yield"** - automatically kinda yield from your loops from time to time (priority based). Can be used to make a proper coroutine (which will not hangs on its endless loops) even from the long-running CPU-hungry third-party function (by function's bytecode modification made in runtime).
            * **"tkinter"** - make your Tkninter app async easily. Run any number of asynchronous Tkinter apps in single thread.
            * **"db"** - async wrapper around LMDB which provides an appropriate async API
            * **"asyncio_loop"** - use asyncio-based code directly from your async Cengal-coroutine neither [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) nor [Curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio) able to to do this
            * **"wait_coro"** - 'put_atomic' request is an analogue of [Trio's Nurseries](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) for list of one or more coroutines; 'put_fastest' - returns when at least N of coroutines from the list were done successfully; etc.
            * **"read_write_locker"** - sync primitive usefull for DB creation (was made for a TagDB)
            * **"remote_nodes"** - in progress - connect to any opened listener/port of the node (TCP/UDP/Unix_Socket - doesn't matter), and identify your receiver by name (defined once - during the connection creation process). Uses improved version of the asyncio.streams as a backend in order to have a back pressure and an improved performance (see "efficient_streams" module description below).
        * **"coro_tools"** - tools
            * **"await_coro"** - await Cengal-coroutine or await for a call to the Cengal-service from your asyncio code
            * **"low_latency"** - use standard json module from your coroutines without hangs on huge Json-data (which usually hung even fast json implementation like orjson)
        * **"integrations"** - 
            * **"Qt"** - wrapper around an unmodified Qt (supports: PySide, PySide2, PySide6, PyQt4, PyQt5, PyQt6). Adds asynchronous behavior to Slots. Doesn't require total reimplementation of your Qt app unlike other suggestions and competitors.
            * **"customtkinter"** - wrapper around an unmodified [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). Implements an additional call, Customtkinter async apps needs to be executed for a proper work
            * **"nicegui"** - wrapper around an unmodified [NiceGUI](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui). Execute nicegui instance from within your code (administrative page for example). Build your pages in an asynchronous way in order to improve your server latency (NiceGUI makes it in a sync way).
            * **"uvicorn"** - wrapper around an unmodified [uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn). Run uvicorn as a usual asyncio coroutine.
            * **"uvloop"** - an easy-install for a [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) (if awailable).
            * **"PyTermGUI"** - wrapper around an unmodified PyTermGUI. Adds asynchronous behavior. No competitors currently.
    * **"asyncio"** - tools for an asyncio
        * **"efficient_streams"** - more efficient remake of an [asyncion.streams](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html). Better awailable traffic limits utilisation. Less kerner-calls number. Back pressure. Unlike asyncio, UDP version is planned but is not ready yet.
* **"code_flow_control"** - 
    * **"python_bytecode_manipulator"** - modify your or third-party Python function's code in runtime easily
    * **"chained_flow"** - easy to use monad. Execute your your code if all/none/some of steps were completed withot an exceptions. Use all/none/some resutls of your steps at the final part of monad execution.
    * **"multiinterface_essence"** - Make your model and add different interfaces to it easily. Can be used for example in games: create "chair", "ball", "person" models and add to them your library of general interfaces like "touch", "push", "sit", "shot", "burn", "wet", etc.
* **"hardware"** - hardware related
    * **"memory"** - RAM related
        * **"barriers"** - fast full memory barriers for both x86/x64 and ARM (Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS, Android).
* **"time_management"** - 
    * **"high_precision_sync_sleep"** - provides an ability to put your thread into legetimate sleep for at least 10x smaller time period than `time.sleep()` from the Python's Standard Library able to do on same Operating System: uses `nanosleep()` on Linux and periodic `SwitchToThread()` on Windows.
    * **"cpu_clock_cycles"** - Returnes value of `RDTSCP` on x86/x86_64 or `CNTVCT_EL0` on ARM. Fast implementation: 6-12 times faster than all other competitors on Github. Note: CPU Time Stamp Counter (TSC) is not depends on actual current CPU frequency in modern CPUs (starting from around year 2007) so can be safely used as a high precision clock (see `time_management.cpu_clock` module). Windows, Linux and other Operating Systems are using it internaly.
    * **"cpu_clock"** - like `perf_counter()` but 25% faster. Supports both x86/x86_64 and ARM. `cpu_clock` is slightly faster than `cpu_clock_cycles` because `double` (`float` in Python terms) transfered from C-code to Python code more efficiently than `64-bit int` (which needs an addition internal logic inside the Python itself for conversion). Highest-precision possible since it is CPU Time Stamp Counter based which is not depends on actual current CPU frequency in modern CPUs (starting from around year 2007) so can be safely used as a high precision clock (and Windows, Linux and other Operating Systems are using it internaly in this way). **Benchmark**: [cpu_clock_test.py](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal/blob/master/cengal/time_management/cpu_clock/versions/v_0/development/cpu_clock_test.py)

```

Windows:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal.git
cd .\Cengal
.\prepare__setup.cmd
.\install_in_dev_mode.cmd
```

Installation process requires compilation. So ensure that:
* GCC/Clang is installed in your Linux/WSL (`sudo apt-get --yes install build-essential` for Ubuntu. And `./before_install_on_wsl.sh` for Ubuntu under WSL for UI like Tkinter or Qt if you are using some kind of XServer on your host Windows)
* At least `Visual Studio Community - Build Tools` are installed on your Windows and you are installing Cengal from within its `Developer Command Prompt` for an appropriate target CPU architecture (`x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` for example). Make sure that you have compatible version of Visual Studio for your target CPython interpreter (see `python -VV` command output. For example `Python 3.9.11 (tags/v3.9.11:2de452f, Mar 16 2022, 14:33:45) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]`: this python interpreter requires Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11.2+ according to `1929` word search in [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B))
* Nim installed (Optional)
