## Prepare

* Install Golang. You may use this instruction as an example: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-20-04
* Install Gopy. Use an official instruction: https://github.com/go-python/gopy. Also you do not need to adjust `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually: we are adjusting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` exclusively for the running session of gopy process automatically.
